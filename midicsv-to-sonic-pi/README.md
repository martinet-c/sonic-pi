How to convert a MIDI file (.mid) to a Sonic Pi file (.rb)?
1. Use MIDICSV to convert you MIDI file to a CSV file: https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/
2. Run midicsv-to-sonic-pi.rb in Sonic Pi

It worked for me with simple MIDI files, I can't guarantee that it will work with every MIDI files!
